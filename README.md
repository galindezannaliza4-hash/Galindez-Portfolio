# Reflection
# Challenges Faced and Solutions
While working on my portfolio, I faced a lot of frustration because my internet was slow. This made it difficult to test my website often and upload files quickly. Sometimes, waiting for pages to load or files to upload took a long time, which slowed down my progress. It was challenging to see if my changes worked right away, and that made me feel stuck at times.
Another challenge was that some parts of the design and coding were hard to understand. I struggled with how to make the layout look nice and how to add certain features in JavaScript. It was not always easy to find clear answers.
To solve these problems, I tried to stay patient and calm. I broke down big tasks into smaller, easier steps so I could focus on one thing at a time. When I couldn’t use the internet well, I worked offline with code editors and planned what I wanted to do next. I also searched for simple tutorials and examples that explained things in a way I could follow. These helped me learn and fix problems step by step. Even though it was hard, I kept going and learned a lot from the experience.

# Future Improvements
In the future, I want to improve my portfolio in several ways. First, I plan to add animations to make the site more lively and interesting. Animations can help guide visitors’ attention and make using the site more enjoyable. I also want to improve the navigation to make it easier for people to find information quickly. This will help visitors have a better experience when exploring my portfolio.
Another important improvement is to make the contact form work properly by connecting it to a backend service. Right now, the form does not actually send messages, so making it functional will allow people to contact me directly through the website. This will make my portfolio more useful and professional.
I also want to focus on making the website load faster. Since I experienced slow internet while building the portfolio, I understand how important speed is. I will optimize images, reduce file sizes, and use efficient coding practices to help the site load quickly, even on slower connections. This will improve accessibility and keep visitors engaged.
Overall, these improvements will make my portfolio more interactive, user-friendly, and professional, helping me showcase my skills better and connect with others.
